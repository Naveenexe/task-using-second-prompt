# 📱 AI-First Orientation Clock

A mobile-first web application that detects device orientation and displays different features based on how users hold their device.

## 🎯 Features

| Orientation | Feature | Description |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| 📱 Portrait Up | ⏰ Alarm Clock | Set alarms with audio alerts |
| 📱 Portrait Down | ⏱️ Timer | Countdown timer with progress bar |
| 📱 Landscape Right | 🏃 Stopwatch | Precise timing display |
| 📱 Landscape Left | 🌤️ Weather Today | Comprehensive weather data with icons |

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Open the application:**
   ```
   Open index.html in your mobile browser
   ```

2. **Grant permissions (iOS devices):**
   - Tap "Enable Orientation Detection" when prompted
   - Allow location access for weather features

3. **Use the app:**
   - Rotate your device to switch between features
   - Use manual controls if orientation detection isn't available

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- **Frontend:** Pure HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **APIs:** Device Orientation API, Geolocation API, OpenWeatherMap API
- **Design:** Mobile-first responsive with CSS Grid/Flexbox
- **Audio:** Web Audio API for alerts

## 📱 Orientation Mapping

### **Correct Device Orientations:**
- **Portrait Upright** (beta≈0°, gamma≈0°) → Alarm Clock
- **Portrait Upside Down** (beta≈±180°, gamma≈0°) → Timer  
- **Landscape Right** (beta≈0°, gamma≈90°) → Stopwatch
- **Landscape Left** (beta≈0°, gamma≈-90°) → Weather

### **Manual Controls:**
5-button navigation for devices without orientation support:
- ⏰ Alarm Clock
- ⏱️ Timer  
- 🏃 Stopwatch
- 🌤️ Weather
- 📱 Guide
